<h1>Cherry Chocolate Mouse</h1>
<p id="subtitlerecepies">It serves 6 people and takes 30 minutes to cook.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul id="ingredients">
    <li>200 g quality dark chocolate</li>
    <li>400 g pitted cherries in syrup</li>
    <li>200 ml double cream</li>
    <li>4 large free-range eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of golden caster sugar</li>
</ul>
<BR>
<h2>Method</h2>
    <p>Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water, then remove to cool for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, simmer the cherries and their syrup in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat until thick, then remove.</p>
    <p>Whip the cream to very soft peaks. Separate the eggs, add the yolks to the cream with the sugar, and whisk to combine. Add a pinch of sea salt to the whites and, with a clean whisk, beat until super-stiff. Fold the cooled chocolate into the cream, then very gently fold that through the egg whites with a spatula.</p>
    <p>Divvy up the mousse between six glasses or bowls, interspersing the cherries and syrup throughout, and finishing with a few nice cherries on top.</p>
